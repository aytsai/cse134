    Design Specs for Code 418</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>overview & requirements</h2>
    <p>Code 418's website will be a website that provides a QuizMaker and a QuizTaker where the user (Professor) will be able to create a quiz where his students will be able to take the quiz using our QuizTaker. The Client wants to save time in making quizzes for his classes and so he wants a website that will help save time by making it easier to make his quizzes. He also wants his students to have an easy time taking the quiz so they do not complain about having to go back to his typical printed quizzes. This means that Code 418's QuizMaker and QuizTaker will have to make creating the quizzes easy while also providing easy functionality for quiz taking.</p>

    <h2>audience</h2>
    <h3 class="emphasize">Professors...</h3> are getting busier with their lives, and they want to be able to save time when they make quizzes for their students. Also, the rate of cheating has been going up during quiz taking so the professor might want to be able to have a functionality that will randomize the order of questions and answers for the quiz taker. We aim to create an intuitive and simple interface so that the professor spends as little time as possible adjusting to the new quiz making controls. Our website will provide everything they need in order for them to save time in making their quizzes.<br>
    <h3 class="emphasize">Students...</h3> have been complaining about the functionality of TED and other online test taking websites. Students have been wanting a new quiz taking website that will have them in mind and since we, the web designers, are also students, we're able to understand what they would want in a test taker.
